The side arguing for stricter regulations to regulate LLMs presented a more compelling case. Their arguments were structured around concrete, evidence-based risks—including misinformation, bias, security breaches, economic exploitation, and accountability gaps—with specific examples (e.g., the 2023 deepfake crisis in Asia, Amazon’s discriminatory recruitment AI, and phishing attacks using GPT-4) and references to studies (e.g., MIT, Stanford). They effectively addressed the counterargument that regulations stifle innovation by drawing parallels to aviation safety standards, showing that well-crafted regulations can coexist with progress. Their case was proactive, emphasizing the societal and ethical imperative to act before risks escalate, and they proposed tangible regulatory solutions like bias audits, liability frameworks, and international cooperation. In contrast, the opposing side relied heavily on economic projections and hypotheticals (e.g., GDPR costs, Gartner report figures) without directly engaging with the severe real-world harms already documented. While they raised valid points about innovation and regulatory lag, their arguments were less grounded in specific LLM-related evidence and more in general economic theory. The pro-regulation side demonstrated a stronger grasp of the unique, urgent threats posed by unregulated LLMs and offered a more balanced, actionable path forward, making their case the more compelling and evidence-backed.
